# Modularize code for creating a model with transfer learning using Pytorch


### What will this model show?
what would this modularize model code show? how will it help my technical doc?
- for the model building section it will give me something to show and also I can speak about how modularizing it helps 
make it more production ready, and extensible
- trasnfer learning is also a plus to show
- code to deploy it to a end point is another plus
- code to include the use of multiple GPUs is also a plus

Does the code for food matching matters? I dont think so becasue it the same concepts
