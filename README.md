### Modularize code for creating a model with transfer learning using Pytorch

This project shows how to create a pytorch model in a modular way.  
This way of creating models allow for the following beneifts:
- Extensibility makes the code more maintainable by separating different functionalities in the code; 
- Reusability; you can easily take and reuse different parts of the code for another project
- Readability; it is easier for you to diagnose and troubleshoot problems
